# Snake Game with C using Raylib 

This is my first game project made in C with raylib. 

For these glamorous coding experience, i choose to make a classic snake game, but in my way (that means there is no border collision).

The total development time, incredebly took only 2 hours, which is incredible, since i haven't writen any C code for a year, and barely remembered how to propertly use pointers. That proves how great to understand raylib is.
